## GJT Analysis
This MATLAB code automates the GJT scoring process for BLAST and SPOLI participants. It uses information about the results from participant's online GJT test and their age to determine their standard score. 
# General Guideline for GJT Analysis
* The working directory is set as: cd /Volumes/data-1/projects/blast/matlab_scripts/gjt_sharon_working/
* The files needed to run this code are: 
   * raw SPOLI data (csv file)
   *raw BLAST data (csv file)
** gjt standard score conversion table (csv file)
** SPOLI participant ages (csv file)
** BLAST participant ages (csv file)
